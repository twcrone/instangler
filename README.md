# Instrumentation Angler
Parses settings.gradle file for angler data to go in metric_names.txt

This is a fairly straightforward tool to parse instrumentation settings in the New Relic Java Agent
project and spit out lines for `metric_names.txt` in the `angler` project.

I'm doing this as a simple exercise to force me to use Rust a little as Andr√© from my team keeps
challenging me to try out Rust now that I've got a decent base understanding of Go.
